Introduction
============

RIESLING is a command-line tool for reconstructing non-cartesian MRI scans. It has been tuned specifically for reconstructing 3D radial center-out trajectories associated with Zero Echo-Time (ZTE) or Ultrashort Echo-Time (UTE) sequences. These trajectories are notably different from Cartesian trajectories (either 2D or 3D), and provide unique challenges in efficient reconstruction.

RIESLING is provided as a single executable file, similar to `bart`. The `riesling` executable provides multiple invididual commands, which vary from basic utilities to interrogate files to complete reconstruction pipelines.
