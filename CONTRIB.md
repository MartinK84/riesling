# Contributing to RIESLING

Welcome to RIESLING. Any help is very much appreciated.

These guidelines exist to make it easy to get involved and ensure that RIESLING is welcoming to everyone.

## Asking Questions / Reporting Bugs

If you have general questions about how to use RIESLING programs, you can either open an [issue](https://github.com/spinicist/riesling/issues).

If you think you have found a bug, then opening a Github issue is the preferred avenue. Please check whether an identical or similar issue already exists first. When opening a new issue, please give as much information as you can, including

- The operating system you are running on.
- A description of the bug, including the full shell command you ran and any input files.
